"""
Given two strings s and t, return true if and only if the characters in s can be replaced to get t with a one-to-one mapping (bijection) between characters of s and t. No two different characters in s may map to the same character in t, and each character must map consistently.
Examples
s="egg", t="add" → true
s="foo", t="bar" → false
s="paper", t="title" → true
Notes
Lengths must be equal to be isomorphic.
Mapping is character-to-character; order must be preserved.
