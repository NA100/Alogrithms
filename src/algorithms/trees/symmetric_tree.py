Symmetric (Mirror) Tree — Problem Statement
Given the root of a binary tree, determine whether it is symmetric around its center—i.e., whether the left subtree is a mirror of the right subtree.
A tree is symmetric if for every pair of mirrored nodes:
Both are null, or
Both are non-null with equal values, and their children cross-match:
left.left ↔ right.right
left.right ↔ right.left
