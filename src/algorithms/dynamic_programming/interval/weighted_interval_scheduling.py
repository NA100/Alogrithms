Got it — Weighted Interval Scheduling is a classic DP + binary search problem.
It’s like knapsack, but instead of capacity, you have time intervals that can’t overlap.
Problem
You are given n jobs, each with:
start time
end time
profit (or weight)
Goal: Pick a subset of non-overlapping jobs that maximizes total profit.
